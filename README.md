# Next Restaurant
A restaurant page I created using Next.js, TailwindCSS, PostgreSQL, and TypeScript.
## Features:
* Fully functioning Front-end
  * Reservation form submits reservations to backend database
  * Contact us form has no functionality other than looks (this is not a real restaurant)
## Current Plans:
* Refine Front-end Design
* Add backend to access, update, and delete reservations
