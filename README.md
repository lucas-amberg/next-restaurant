# Next Restaurant
A restaurant page I created using Next.js, TailwindCSS, PostgreSQL, and TypeScript.
## Features:
* Fully functioning Front-end
  * Reservation form submits reservations to backend database
  * Contact us form has no functionality other than looks (this is not a real restaurant, but if it were this could be easily implemented using a library such as EmailJS)
* Functional back-end and admin page accessible at /admin
  * If you are interested in seeing the admin page contact me and I can demo for you
  * Admin panel displays all reservations from current date on and filters/removes all old reservations on page load
  * Ability to delete reservations as needed
## Current Plans:
* Refine Front-end Design
